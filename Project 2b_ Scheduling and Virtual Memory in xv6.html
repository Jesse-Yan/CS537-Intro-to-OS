<h2>Important Dates</h2> 

<p><b>Questions about the project?</b> Use piazza.</p> 

<p><b>Due:</b> Monday 10/25 (Grace period: 2 days).</p> 

<h2>Updates</h2> 


<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>The scheduling part of the project is described
<a href="https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/scheduling-xv6-lottery">
here.</a> Please read the description carefully and watch
<a href="https://youtu.be/eYfeOT1QYmg">this video.</a> </p> 

<p>The virtual memory part of the project is described
<a href="https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/vm-xv6-intro">here.</a> Please read the description carefully and watch
<a href="https://youtu.be/es1JjdlCBms">this video.</a> </p> 

<h2>Differences</h2> 

<p><b>PLEASE READ:</b> There are some differences in this project versus the
descriptions above. Notably:

</p><ul>
<li>Your scheduler will not be a lottery scheduler; it will instead be a
simpler deterministic proportional-share scheduler. Specifically,
if a process has N tickets, instead of running one time slice and then
switching to another process, it will run N time slices in a row before
switching. The number of time slices in a row a process runs is set by the
same call to settickets(). Thus, if there are two RUNNABLE processes (A and B,
say) in the system, one that has 3 tickets (A) and one that has 1 (B), the
running pattern will be AAABAAAB ... etc. Everything else about the project
remains the same (there are two system calls to implement, you need to make a
graph, etc.)</li> 

<li>You only have to implement the null-pointer dereference part of the VM
project. You <b>do not</b> have to implement the call to mprotect() / read-only
code part of the project.</li> 

</ul> 
<p></p> 

<h2>Notes</h2> 

<p>This project is the last one to be <b>done by yourself</b> this
semester. Congratulations on making it this far! Copying code is considered
cheating. Read <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2021/dontcheat.html">this</a> for more info on what is OK and
what is not.</p> 

<p>This project is to be done on the lab machines (listed
<a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/docs/csl/2012-08-16-instructional-facilities/">
here</a> ), so you can learn more about programming in C on a typical UNIX-based
platform (Linux).</p> 


<h2>The Code</h2> 

<p>The source code for xv6 (and associated README) can be found in <b>
~cs537-1/public/xv6.tgz</b> . Everything you need to build and run and even debug the
kernel is in there.</p> 


<h2>Handing It In</h2> 

<p>The handin directory is <code>~cs537-1/handin/login/p2b</code> where <code>login</code> is
your login.</p> 

<p>Copy all of your source files (but not .o files, please, or binaries!) into
the <code>p2b/</code> subdirectory. A simple way to do this is to copy everything
into the destination directory directory, then type <code>make</code> to make sure
it builds, and then type <code>make clean</code> to remove unneeded files.</p> 

<p>Finally, in your p2b directory, please make a README file to describe what
you did, and include your graph in there too, called <b>graph.pdf</b> (great
name, huh?).</p>
