<h1>Project 1b: Warm-up Project (xv6)</h1> 
</font> 
</center> 

<h2>Important Dates and Other Stuff</h2> 

<p><b>Due:</b> Monday, 9/27 by midnight.</p> 

<p><b>This project is to be done by yourself.</b> </p> 

<h2>Questions?</h2> 

<p>Post questions to Piazza or ask in person during lab help hours or office
hours. If the question is about your code, copy all of of your code into your
handin directory (details below) and include your login in your email (you are
free to modify the contents of your handin directory prior to the due
date). Also include all other relevant information, such as cutting and
pasting what you typed and the results from the screen. In general, the more
information you give, the more we can help. If you use Piazza for questions,
don't include code unless you are sure you are making the post private.</p> 

<h2>Overview</h2> 

<p>The project is <b>mostly</b> like the one found
<a href="https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/initial-xv6">here.</a> 
Please read this carefully in order to understand exactly what to do.</p> 

<p><b>However,</b> there is a small difference. Instead of implementing <b>getreadcount()</b> ,
you will implement <b>getiocount()</b> , which counts both the numbers of reads and the number
of writes that have taken place.</p> 

<p>This project is to be done on the lab machines (listed
<a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/docs/csl/2012-08-16-instructional-facilities/">here</a> ), so
you can learn more about programming in C on a typical UNIX-based platform
(Linux).</p> 

<h2>Notes</h2> 

<p><b>This project should be done alone.</b> Copying code (from others) is
considered cheating. Read <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2021/dontcheat.html">this</a> for more info on
what is OK and what is not. Please help us all have a good semester by not
doing this.</p> 

<h2>The Code</h2> 

<p>The source code for xv6 (and associated README) can be found in <b>
~cs537-1/public/xv6.tgz</b> . Everything you need to build and run and even debug the
kernel is in there. The way to make your own version is to do the following:</p> 

<p>
</p><pre>prompt&gt; mkdir xv6
prompt&gt; cd xv6
prompt&gt; tar xvzf ~cs537-1/public/xv6.tgz
</pre> 

<p>This will create an xv6-public directory in the xv6 directory. You can then cd into that and begin working.</p> 

<h2>Testing</h2> 

<p>We will make tests available as usual.</p> 

<h2>Handing It In</h2> 

<p>Put your entire xv6 source tree into your handin directory, under directory
<b>p1b</b> . Then, change directories into the handin and make sure the tests
still work. Finally, type 'make clean' so that the built kernel isn't left in
place there.</p> 

<p>When we cd into your p1b directory, we shouldn't see just an xv6/ directory;
rather, we should see the xv6 source code (including the main Makefile,
and all the .c, .h., .s files, etc.). For example:</p> 

<p>
</p><pre>prompt&gt; cd ~cs537-1/handin/remzi/p1b
prompt&gt; ls
asm.h elf.h init.c main.c printf.c sign.pl sysfile.c usertests.c
...
(etc.)
</pre> <p></p> 

<p><b>Note:</b> your results for ls don't have to look exactly like this, but
should be similar and contain the import directories and makefiles.</p>
